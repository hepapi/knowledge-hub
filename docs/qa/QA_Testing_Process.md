# Fundamental Testing Process

## 1.Test Planning and Defining Strategy
Testing begins with planning, aligning procedures with project objectives.

### Key Steps:
- **Defining Scope:** Identify areas to be tested and those excluded.
- **Resource Allocation:** Organize equipment, tools, and team members.
- **Timeline Creation:** Set deadlines for each phase.
- **Risk Management:** Assess potential risks and create mitigation strategies.

### Defining Strategy:
- Choose test types (functional, performance, security).
- Specify tools (e.g., Selenium, Postman).
- Clarify test success criteria.

## 2.Writing Test Scenarios and Test Cases
- **Test Scenarios:** High-level user flows.
  - Example: "The user should access their profile page after logging in."
- **Test Cases:** Detailed steps.
  - Example:
    1. Open login screen.
    2. Enter username/password.
    3. Click "Login" button.
    - **Expected Result:** Redirect to homepage.

### Risk Analysis:
- High-risk areas (e.g., payment processes) need rigorous testing.
- Less used modules have lower priority.

## 3.Bug Reporting
A good bug report includes:
- **Category:** Performance, UI, security.
- **Severity:** Impact level (e.g., login failure vs. button misalignment).
- **Reproduction Steps:** Detailed actions to replicate the bug.
- **Supporting Materials:** Screenshots, error logs, etc.

## 4.Test Tracking and Reporting
Use tools like Jira or TestRail to manage test statuses and open bugs.

### Reporting:
- Regular updates (daily, weekly, sprint-based).

### Metrics:
- Resolved bugs ratio.
- Remaining workload.

## 5.Preparing Test Environments
Ensure a realistic and reliable test environment.
- **Accurate Data:** Use dummy data.
- **Accessibility:** Seamless team access.
- **Backup/Recovery:** Prepare for data loss.
