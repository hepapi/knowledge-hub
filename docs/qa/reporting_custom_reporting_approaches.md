# Custom Reporting Approaches


Custom reporting approaches are used when standard reporting tools do not fully meet a project’s needs. In such cases, teams design tailored reporting solutions that focus on the metrics, formats, and insights most relevant to their product and stakeholders.

These approaches allow teams to move beyond generic pass/fail results and highlight quality indicators that matter most to the business.

## When Custom Reporting Is Needed

Custom reporting is typically preferred when:

- Project-specific KPIs are required
- Standard reports lack necessary context
- Stakeholders need simplified or targeted summaries
- Quality metrics must align closely with business flows

In complex systems, off-the-shelf reports may not reflect real user impact or critical paths.

## Common Custom Reporting Examples

Custom reporting solutions may include:

- Dashboards built from test execution data
- Aggregated reports combining manual and automated results
- Release-focused summaries highlighting critical failures
- Trend analysis across multiple test cycles

These reports are often generated using test outputs, database queries, or pipeline artifacts.

## Integration with CI/CD and Team Tools

Custom reports are frequently integrated into CI/CD pipelines and shared automatically through internal tools such as dashboards, messaging platforms, or documentation portals.

This ensures that quality insights are delivered at the right time without manual effort, supporting faster feedback and decision-making.

## Benefits of Custom Reporting

By tailoring reports to project needs, teams gain:

- Better visibility into real quality risks
- More meaningful release insights
- Improved communication with non-technical stakeholders

Custom reporting helps position QA not only as a testing function, but as a contributor to product quality strategy.

## Why Custom Reporting Matters

Every project has different quality priorities. Custom reporting allows teams to adapt their reporting strategy to those priorities, ensuring that test results remain relevant, actionable, and aligned with both technical and business goals.

Over time, this flexibility supports more informed decisions and more predictable releases.
