# Software Testing Tools

Software testing is the process of checking whether the functionality, quality, and performance of a software meet user expectations. Testing tools and technologies offer software that makes this process faster, more efficient, and effective. They enhance quality and reduce error rates by supporting testing processes either manually or through automation.
