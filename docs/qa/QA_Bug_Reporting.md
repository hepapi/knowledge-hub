# Bug Management

## 1 What is a Bug?
A bug is a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior of a system. Bugs can be categorized as follows:

- **Coding Bugs:** Issues originating from developer errors.
- **Requirement Bugs:** Problems caused by incorrect or incomplete requirements.
- **UI Bugs:** Design and usability issues in the user interface.
- **Performance Bugs:** System slowdowns or crashes under high load.

## 2 Types of Bugs
Proper classification of bugs is crucial for determining resolution priorities.

- **Critical:** Bugs that cause system crashes or prevent main functions from working. Example: Payment system not operational.
- **Major:** Bugs that affect significant functions but can be temporarily worked around. Example: Login fails for some users.
- **Minor:** Bugs that affect user experience but do not break the system. Example: Misaligned button.
- **Trivial:** Low-priority bugs, often cosmetic. Example: Typo in text.

## 3 Bug Tracking Tools
Bug tracking tools like Jira allow teams to:
- Create and assign bugs to specific members.
- Track the bug resolution process (open, in progress, resolved).
- Share bug reports easily.

### Steps in Bug Management
1. **Detection:** Identify the bug during testing.
2. **Reporting:** Log a detailed report in the system.
3. **Analysis:** Investigate the root cause.
4. **Resolution:** Fix and re-test the bug.
5. **Closure:** Close the bug once resolved.

Transparency is critical throughout the process.
