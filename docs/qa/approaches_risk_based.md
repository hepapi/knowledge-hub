# Risk-Based Testing


Testing with Intent: Focus Where It Matters Most

Let's be honest. In a project that needs to move quickly, we sometimes don't have the opportunity to test every single pixel multiple times. In such scenarios, you need a strategy to protect your business and users at their most vulnerable points. That's where Risk-Based Testing comes in. We don't just test randomly; we test intelligently. We analyze the project and identify its "high-risk" areas. For example, for an e-commerce site, this might be the payment process. Or for a healthcare application, data privacy is crucial. If these processes fail, the impact is significant. By focusing on these critical areas in such scenarios, we ensure that these features remain robust and reliable, even under the tightest deadlines.
