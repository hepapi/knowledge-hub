# Code Review in Test Automation

Test code is just as important as production code. Therefore, code reviews should also be mandatory for automation projects.

## Why It Matters

A proper review process helps:

- Eliminate duplicate code
- Improve readability and maintainability
- Catch incorrect assertions early
- Spread best practices across the team

## What to Check During Reviews

- Proper abstraction (Page Object Model, reusable methods)
- Avoiding hard-coded values
- Eliminating unnecessary waits or sleeps
- Ensuring test independence
- Clear and meaningful test names

High-quality test code leads to sustainable automation.
