# TMS + Automation Integrations


TMS (Test Management System) and automation integrations are used to connect automated test executions with test case management tools. This integration helps teams keep test results, coverage, and execution history centralized and up to date.

Instead of managing manual and automated tests separately, teams gain a unified view of overall test quality.

## How the Integration Works

In an integrated setup, automated test executions push their results directly into the TMS. Each automated scenario is linked to a corresponding test case, allowing execution results to be tracked without manual updates.

This setup ensures that test case status reflects real execution outcomes.

## Benefits of Integrating TMS with Automation

With proper integration, teams can:

- Automatically update test results after automation runs
- Track manual and automated coverage in one place
- Reduce repetitive manual reporting
- Maintain consistent traceability between test cases and executions

This leads to a more efficient and reliable testing process.

## Supporting Continuous Testing

TMS and automation integrations play an important role in continuous testing strategies. Automated test results can be collected after each pipeline run, providing immediate feedback on system stability and regressions.

This enables teams to detect issues earlier and respond faster.

## Visibility and Reporting

When automation results are reflected in the TMS, reporting becomes more meaningful. Teams can easily answer questions such as:

- Which test cases are automated?
- What percentage of regression is covered by automation?
- How did automation results affect the latest release?

This visibility supports better planning and more informed release decisions.

## Why TMS + Automation Integration Matters

Integrating automation with a TMS helps align testing efforts across the team. It reduces manual overhead, improves transparency, and ensures that test documentation remains accurate as the product evolves.

Over time, this integration becomes a key foundation for scalable and sustainable test practices.
