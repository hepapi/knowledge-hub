# Continuous Testing

## Continuous Testing in Modern Development

In modern software development, testing is no longer an activity performed only at the end. It is a continuous and integrated process.

## What Continuous Testing Means

- Automated tests after every commit
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Fast feedback loops
- Early defect detection

## Benefits of This Approach

- Reduces risks
- Improves release reliability
- Minimizes manual regression testing

Test automation should be a natural and inseparable part of the delivery pipeline.
