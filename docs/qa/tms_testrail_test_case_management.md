# Test Case Management (TestRail)

Test Case Management is the process of documenting and maintaining test scenarios in a clear and structured way so they can be consistently reused throughout the project. In TestRail, this structure helps teams keep both manual and automated tests organized and accessible in a single place.

Rather than being a static list of test steps, test cases act as living documentation of how the product is expected to behave.

## What We Aim to Achieve

- Maintain reliable and consistent test coverage
- Reduce the risk of missing critical scenarios during regression testing
- Keep testing practices aligned across the team
- Ensure test knowledge remains available even when team members change

## Test Case Management in Practice

### Creating Test Cases

A typical test case in TestRail includes a short, descriptive title, preconditions, clear test steps and the expected test result. The priority or test type helps a team decide when and how often a test should be executed.

### Organizing Test Cases

Test cases are usually grouped by features, modules, or user flows. This makes it easier to understand the scope of testing and quickly find relevant scenarios when preparing test runs or regression suites.

### Keeping Test Cases Maintainable

Well-written test cases are designed to be reusable. Common scenarios are maintained in one place and updated when product behavior changes, which helps avoid duplicated work and keeps regression suites up to date.

### Supporting Manual and Automated Testing

TestRail allows teams to manage test cases that are executed manually as well as those covered by automation. Linking automated tests to existing test cases helps maintain traceability and provides a clear view of overall test coverage.

### Ensuring Traceability

Test cases can be linked to requirements, user stories, or reported defects. This connection helps teams understand which parts of the product are validated and where potential gaps may exist.

## Why It’s Important

A solid Test Case Management approach makes testing more predictable and easier to scale. It improves release confidence, supports smoother onboarding for new team members, and reduces dependency on individual knowledge. Over time, test cases become a reliable reference point for both product behavior and quality expectations.
