# Shift-Left Testing


What is the importance of early testing?

In the early days of technology, testing was the final step before product launch, the last hurdle before the product went live. But waiting until the last minute is like checking the building plans after construction is finished. It can be quite stressful and equally expensive. Shift-Left is one of the best methods for such scenarios.

So how can Shift-Left help you? The goal of Shift-Left is not to find bugs after development is complete, but to prevent these bugs before development. As a QA team, we meet with designers, analysts, and developers before any line of code is written and ask "What if..." questions early on. This ensures a healthier project progress, reduces the cost of future corrections, and allows us to reach the project completion deadline with confidence, not with last-minute panic.
