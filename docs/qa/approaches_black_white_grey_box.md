# Black / White / Grey Box Testing


## Seeing the Full Picture: The Three Perspectives of Quality

Testing is not only about finding errors; it is also about understanding from which perspective an issue occurs. These three approaches help evaluate software quality from different angles.

### Black Box Testing

Think about using your favorite app. You do not think about the code in the background; you just expect the app to work correctly when you click a button.

Black box testing follows this same approach. From a user perspective, it focuses on:

- Exploring the interface
- Interacting with clickable elements
- Scrolling and navigation behavior
- Entering and validating inputs

The internal code is not considered during execution.

### White Box Testing

While user experience is critical, internal code quality also matters. White box testing examines the implementation to ensure:

- Clean and maintainable design
- Correct logic and structure
- Strong security practices
- Long-term reliability of the application

It is similar to taking an X-ray of the software.

### Grey Box Testing

Grey box testing combines both perspectives. The tester behaves like a user but also has partial knowledge of system internals, such as architecture or documentation.

This helps validate whether user actions correctly match backend rules, such as database behavior, and makes it easier to identify root causes when failures occur.
