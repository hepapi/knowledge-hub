# Black / White / Grey Box Testing


Seeing the Full Picture: The Three Perspectives of Quality

Testing isn't just about finding errors; it's also about our perspective on how the problem occurred.We use three different way to make sure your software is flawless from every angle.

- Black Box Testing: Let's think about our favorite app. When we use it, we never think about the code written in the background, right? We just want the app to work correctly when we press the button. That's exactly what Black Box testing is. From a user's perspective, it's about exploring the interface without dealing with the code of the object being tested, checking clickable elements, scrolling if necessary, and entering input where it's possible.
- White Box Testing: While we prioritize user experience, what's happening behind the scenes is equally important. We examine the code to ensure it's soundly and cleanly designed, with robust security and a long lifespan for the application. It's like taking an X-ray of the software.
- Grey Box Testing: In some cases, we may need to use both techniques we mentioned earlier. We act as a user, but we also have documentation showing how the system works in the background. This helps us determine if specific actions performed by the user match a particular database rule in the background, and if not, identify any errors that may occur.
