# Test Maintenance Strategies


Writing tests is only the beginning. Keeping them maintainable over time is equally important. Otherwise, automation quickly turns into technical debt.

## How to Improve Maintainability

- Use the Page Object Model (POM)
- Create reusable helper functions
- Centralize test data management
- Reduce code duplication
- Design modular test structures

Regular refactoring and removing outdated or unused tests are also essential.

Remember: automation that cannot be maintained becomes more expensive than manual testing.
