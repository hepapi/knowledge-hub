# Exploratory Testing


The Human Touch in a World of Algorithms

While automated tests are great for checking repetitive tasks, they lack human curiosity. That's where Exploratory Testing comes in. Our experienced QA team sets aside command-based automated tests and tries to think like a distracted parent, a hasty manager, or a hacker.

We act outside of normal behavior to find edge cases, searching for strange and unexpected errors that are in line with human nature but wouldn't occur to a machine or system.

This approach not only finds bugs but also ensures the application is not only functional butalso enjoyabletouse.
