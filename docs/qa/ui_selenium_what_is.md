# What is Selenium?

# The Foundation of Web Test Automation

Selenium is one of the most widely used open-source test automation tools for web applications. Since its introduction in 2004, Selenium has become an industry standard, especially in large-scale and enterprise-level projects.

The main purpose of Selenium is to automate user interactions in a browser just as a real user would. By doing so, it helps teams:

- Reduce manual testing effort
- Automate regression tests
- Detect bugs earlier in the development cycle
- Improve overall software quality

One of Selenium’s greatest strengths is that it is not a single tool, but rather an entire ecosystem.

## Why Is Selenium So Widely Used?

Selenium’s popularity comes from several key advantages:

- Open-source and free
- Backed by a large global community
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Works across different browsers
- Proven reliability in enterprise projects
- Highly customizable

However, Selenium truly shines when it is used with the right architecture and best practices.
