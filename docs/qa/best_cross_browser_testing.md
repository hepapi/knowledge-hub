# Cross-Browser Testing


Users access applications through different browsers and devices. Ensuring functionality on only one browser is not enough.

## How Cross-Browser Testing Helps

- Validate compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Detect layout or styling issues
- Identify JavaScript inconsistencies
- Guarantee a consistent user experience

## Best Practices

- Define a browser matrix
- Run critical scenarios on all major browsers
- Use cloud device farms

Before production releases, smoke and regression tests should run across multiple browsers.
